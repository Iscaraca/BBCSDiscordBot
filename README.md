# BBCSDiscordBot
BuildlingBloCS is a yearlong outreach programme for students, by students! Activities and workshops will be conducted by JC Computing students, guided by their teachers, to educate people around the nation about the wonders of Computing, and spread its love :3. Activities need not be entirely technical, and they can be something like creatively integrating Computing concepts into usual activities!

All communications between teachers, organisers, committee members and student participants take place in a discord server, and all requests such as handling of FAQ, role allocation and assignment, and identity confirmation are handled by this trusty bot, built using Javascript and Discord.js.

You probably wouldn't want to add this bot to your server because its job is so specialised, but if you're here because you've encountered problems with your own bot, feel free to look through the source code and make some improvements!
